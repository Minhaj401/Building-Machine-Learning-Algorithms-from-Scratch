# 🧠 Machine Learning from Scratch

Welcome to a hands-on journey into the **inner workings of machine learning**.

This project is all about implementing ML algorithms from scratch — using only Python and NumPy — to build a deeper, intuitive understanding of how things work under the hood.

---

## 💡 Why?

Modern libraries make machine learning easier than ever — and that’s amazing.  
But sometimes, it helps to step back and ask:  
**“What’s actually happening behind `.fit()`?”**

This project is a space to explore that question by rebuilding models line by line, from first principles.

## 📚 What I’m Doing

- Re-implementing classic ML algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, etc.)
- Focusing on the math, logic, and flow behind each algorithm
- Writing clean, readable code for learning and experimentation

---

## 🚀 The Goal

To **demystify machine learning** — one algorithm at a time.

Not to replace libraries, but to **complement** them with deeper understanding.

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration

Learning is better together. If you:

- Have suggestions or ideas
- Want to improve or add an algorithm
- Found a bug or edge case
- Just enjoy digging into ML fundamentals

Feel free to open an issue or pull request — or just drop by to share thoughts!

## 🔥 Why It Matters

Understanding ML at a deeper level builds confidence, insight, and better intuition — whether you’re training models with scikit-learn or building your own from scratch.

_This is a work in progress — as I learn more, I build more, I build more. Let’s grow together._
